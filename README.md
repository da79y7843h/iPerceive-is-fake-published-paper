# Aman Chadha (https://www.linkedin.com/in/amanc/) pretended to have papers that actually haven't been published, who is Generative AI Leadership at Amazon Web Services (AWS)

This repo's paper (iPerceive: Applying Common-Sense Reasoning to Multi-Modal Dense Video Captioning and Video Question Answering https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.07735) is just one example, **which is claimed by Aman Chadha to be a WACV 2021 published paper and has gained more than 70 github stars and 30 citations.** But it is actually a **fake** WACV paper, feel free to verify it on the official website (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/9423008/proceeding).

Aman Chadha has already deleted the original repo.
